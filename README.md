## :question: What is this Repository about?

This project is the outcome of my self-learning about the API Testing Automation framework - Rest-assured.
I heard a lot about Rest-Assured and how it made the QA's life easier by helping them to run all the tedious API tests
in an efficient way.
Hence, I started learning about the framework and have documented all my learnings in this repository with all
example code from writing basic tests to running end to end API automation tests.

## :briefcase: What does this repo contain?

- This repo contains example codes of API Tests using Rest-Assured.
- `Hamcrest Matchers` are used for assertions.
- [TestNG](https://testng.org) Listeners are used to capture the events in logs.
- `Log4j` is used to capture logs.
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) is used to generate Getter and Setters automatically for post body
  requests.
- FAKE Rest APIs on [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) is used for testing.
- End to End scenarios have been added for
  the [restful booker APIs](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html).
