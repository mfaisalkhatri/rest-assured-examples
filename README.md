## Don't forget to give a :star: to make the project popular.

## :question: What is this Repository about?
This project is the outcome of my self-learning the API Testing Automation frameworks - Rest-assured.
I heard a lot about Rest-Assured and how it made the QA's life easier by helping them to run all the tedious API tests in an efficient way.
Hence, I started learning about the framework and have documented all my learnings in this repository.

To get a better understanding on API Testing, check [What is API Testing?][blog_apitesting]

## What does this repo contain?
- This repo contains example codes of API Tests using Rest-Assured.
- Hamcrest Matchers are used for assertions.
- TestNG Listeners are used to capture the events in logs.
- Log4j is used to capture logs.
- Lombok has been used to generate Getter and Setters automatically for post body requests.
- Rest APIs on https://reqres.in/ has been used for testing.

## Talking more about the Scenarios Covered in this project:
- I have covered, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests.
- Sample code to handle the `authentication` requests have also been added.
- End to End scenarios have been added for the [restful booker APIs][restfulbooker].
- Refer [End to API testing using rest-assured][e2eblog]  for better understanding of writing End to End tests using rest-assured framework.
